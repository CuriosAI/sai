# RUN SAI ON WINDOWS

Either use your already downloaded pre-compiled SAI release, or
 if you're an experienced user, compile your own version of SAI.

Here we cover only downloaded ready to use SAI official binaries, see
 [Leela Zero's how to COMPILE SAI](https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero#example-of-compiling---windows)
 if you want to compile SAI by yourself, and adapt these instructions for SAI.

## Download latest SAI release

Open [this page](https://github.com/sai-dev/sai/releases/) and download
 the latest release of SAI fitting the characteristics of your computer.

Then Unzip the archive.

## Run SAI

Then you can use the main program SAI.

### 19x19

You have to open a Windows command prompt in the directory with the program
 to run it.

It will need a network to work and networks can be found on the server.

But you can immediately launch, to see the options:

```Shell
sai.exe --help
```

### 9x9

If you'd rather play with a strong SAI 9x9 network, we provide a compiled
 9x9 executable sai9x9.exe but you can also simply run sai9x9.bat and you
 will play agains the [S1](http://sai.unich.it/networks/94619dea457de054503cec030269ce842c47055ba51e96db8fee841dfbaf05f9.gz)
 network from the 9x9 paper, which is included inside the zip file.

The steps to run SAI are same as above.
